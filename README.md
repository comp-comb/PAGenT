# PAGenT: Particle Aggregate Generator Tool

PAGenT is a simple, tunable Python tool for generating fractal particle aggregates. It leverages Particle Cluster and Cluster-Cluster aggregation algorithms to create customizable fractal structures with adjustable parameters such as particle radii, radius of gyration, and fractal dimension.

## Method

PAGenT implements the aggregation method described in:

**Morán, J., Fuentes, A., Liu, F., & Yon, J. (2019). FracVAL: An improved tunable algorithm of cluster–cluster aggregation for generation of fractal structures formed by polydisperse primary particles. *Comput. Phys. Commun.*, 239, 225–237. doi: 10.1016/j.cpc.2019.01.015**

This algorithm allows for the generation of fractal aggregates formed by polydisperse primary particles, making it ideal for various computational physics and simulation applications.

## Usage

Get started with PAGenT by following these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:comp-comb/PAGenT.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**
   ```bash
